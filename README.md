## Mini C Compiler

As the part of our Compiler course assignments, I have built a mini C compiler that can parse C code, build a symbol table, tokenize the entire code, create an abstract symbol tree and finally, generate **8086 assembly code** that can be run on the emulator **EMU8086**.
My project can report the presence of any syntax errors. In addition, I incorporated some compiler optimizations (e.g. peephole optimization). Mini C compiler is able to successfully handle recursive functions as well as complex mathematical expressions in C.
